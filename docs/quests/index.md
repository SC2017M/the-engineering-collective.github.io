# Quests

## Concept

The concept of a Quest is that of a journey, taken to achieve a certain goal. 

Quests used in this book follow the same concept in principle; as engineers, we set out on journeys to learn new skills to better ourselves in our chosen discipline. This _journey_ can take us anywhere from several days, to several years, depending on the end goal.

## How Quests Are Made

Quests in this book are made up of a high level _Roadmap_, which lays out a learning path for the given Quest. Each _Roadmap_ is then backed by core sections to help facilitate learning;

  * Resources - these can be any type of resource; courses (online & in person), books, blog posts, videos, documentation
  * Certifications - any certifications which can be attained to show progress in given subject
  * Engineer Suggestions - any notes/thoughts from other engineers who've also been going through this quest, on things they've found useful or Gotchas

## Roadmap Skills

The _Roadmap_ is the core makeup of a Quest. For example, to become an experienced Java Engineer, there are several key _skills_ which must be learnt or achieved along to the way, such as; Java fundamentals, object oriented design, build tooling etc. This is the same for all _Quests_, so by having a _Roadmap_ at the high level to help identify the skill tree, it helps build a rough path of guidance through the learning journey.
