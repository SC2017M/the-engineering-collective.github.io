# Quests

## Concept

The concept of a Quest is that of a journey, taken to achieve a certain goal. 

Quests used in this book follow the same concept in principle; as engineers, we set out on journeys to learn new skills to better ourselves in our chosen discipline. This _journey_ can take us anywhere from several days, to several years, depending on the end goal.

## How Quests Are Made

Quests in this book are made up of _Skills_. Each of which are critical in contributing to the overall achievement of the Quest.

## Concept of Skills

A _Skill_ is something which helps make up a Quest. For example, to become an experienced Java Engineer, there are several key _skills_ which must be learnt or achieved along to the way, such as; Java fundamentals, object oriented design, build tooling etc. This is the same for all _Quests_, so having the concept of _Skills_, allows us to break down a _Quest_ into its constituent parts and give clear guidance on how to achieve each of them.
