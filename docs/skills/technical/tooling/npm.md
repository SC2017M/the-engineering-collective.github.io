# Skill: NPM

## Pre-requisites
  * None

## Topics
  * npm (package/dependency manager, task runner, packager)
  * Common npm commands
  * Breakdown of `package.json`
  * Understanding project structure and what to version control 

## Resources
  * [npm Getting Started Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm)
  * [Understanding _package.json_](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json)
  * [npm folders (should be ignored by your VCS)](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/folders)

## Badges
  * JavaScript Build Tools

## Experience Suggestions
  * npm provides a huge amount of tooling (not just package management) and so for small-medium projects that don't require other, more advanced tools, you can simply use _only_ npm and npm packages. For larger projects that require a corporate-standard of stability: using tools like yarn, webpack and grunt can provide extra functionality that npm doesn't fully cover.
