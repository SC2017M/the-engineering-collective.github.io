# Technical Skills

Technical skills are _any_ skills which fall under a technical level, e.g. programming languages, frameworks, tooling etc. 

The following categories exist for technical skills. Can't spot one that fits the skill you want to learn, or maybe there should be more categories that need adding? See the [contributing](../../contributing.md) section to see how you can help improve this collective.

### Frameworks

The Frameworks category houses all library and framework related skills.

### Languages
