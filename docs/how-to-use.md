# How To Use This Book


This book is designed to be used as set of learning materials that you can follow or search through for learning new skills. 

You can use this book however you like, the idea is that there are _paths_ for you to follow, a collection of materials that as a community, we've created to help facilitate a smoother learning journey, formed from our collective experience. It can be challenging learning a new skill, and the idea here is that there are collectives of _Quests_ and _Skills_ which allow you to find the right learning materials based on what you want to learn. 

You can begin by searching for a [Quest](./quests/index.md) or [Skill](./skills/index.md) in the search bar, or just browsing through each section.

Can't find what you're looking for? Maybe there's a new _Quest_ of _Skill_ that needs adding, please see how to [contribute](./contributing.md).
