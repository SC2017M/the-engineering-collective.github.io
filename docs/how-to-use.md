# How To Use This Book


This book is designed to be used as set of learning materials that you can follow or search through for learning new skills. 

You can use this book however you like, the idea is that there are _paths_ for you to follow, a collection of materials that as a community, we've created to help facilitate a smoother learning journey, formed from our collective experience. It can be challenging learning a new skill, and the idea here is that there are collectives of _Quests_, which contain a host of resources relating to different _skills_, allowing you to find the right learning materials based on what you want to learn. 

You can begin by searching for a [Quest](./quests/index.md) in the search bar, or just browsing through the list of available _Quests_.

Can't find what you're looking for? Maybe there's a _Quest_ that needs adding or updating, please see how to [contribute](./contributing.md).
