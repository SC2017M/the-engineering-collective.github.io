Mission Statement The idea behind this book is to gather a wide range of learning materials and experience together to form 'Quests', the idea of which comes from a learning 'journey'. This book is open source. It should be driven through the community. As a collective of engineers with a huge variety of skills and experience, we can use those skills and experience to help up-skill the engineers of the future. I feel we have a responsibility as engineers to share our knowledge as much as possible and to help pave the way for future generations. A Collective Need Starting out on a journey to learn something new can be both daunting and challenging. Where do you begin? How do you recognize the good materials from the bad? How do you know you're on the right path? These are all questions we've asked ourselves along the way when trying to learn or understand something new. We often find ourselves using our favourite search engine to begin the learning journey, but what if we didn't have to go in blindly, and could have reference to a host of learning materials, experience and best practices in one central place. That is precisely how this collective was born. As engineers, we are always looking for consistent approaches when building things, and we always strive to follow best practice when doing so. We don't reinvent the wheel when building software, so why do it when forging a learning path? This book is here to serve as a single, curated collection of tried and tested learning materials. The hope is that when you want to start a new learning journey, rather than visiting your favourite search engine and blindly following links to various materials, you reference this book instead, and tap into a wide variety of industry knowledge from engineers who've paved the way before you.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#the-engineering-collective","text":"This GitBook has been created by the community, and contains a breadth of learning materials, spanning multiple engineering disciplines.","title":"The Engineering Collective"},{"location":"#mission-statement","text":"The idea behind this book is to gather a wide range of learning materials and experience together to form 'Quests', the idea of which comes from a learning 'journey'.

You can use this book however you like, the idea is that there are paths for you to follow, a collection of materials that as a community, we've created to help facilitate a smoother learning journey, formed from our collective experience. It can be challenging learning a new skill, and the idea here is that there are collectives of Quests , which contain a host of resources relating to different skills , allowing you to find the right learning materials based on what you want to learn. You can begin by searching for a Quest in the search bar, or just browsing through the list of available Quests . Can't find what you're looking for?

Quests used in this book follow the same concept in principle; as engineers, we set out on journeys to learn new skills to better ourselves in our chosen discipline. This journey can take us anywhere from several days, to several years, depending on the end goal. How Quests Are Made Quests in this book are made up of a high level Roadmap , which lays out a learning path for the given Quest. Each Roadmap is then backed by core sections to help facilitate learning; Resources - these can be any type of resource; courses (online & in person), books, blog posts, videos, documentation Certifications - any certifications which can be attained to show progress in given subject Engineer Suggestions - any notes/thoughts from other engineers who've also been going through this quest, on things they've found useful or Gotchas Roadmap Skills The Roadmap is the core makeup of a Quest. For example, to become an experienced Java Engineer, there are several key skills which must be learnt or achieved along to the way, such as; Java fundamentals, object oriented design, build tooling etc. This is the same for all Quests , so by having a Roadmap at the high level to help identify the skill tree, it helps build a rough path of guidance through the learning journey.","title":"Quests"},{"location":"quests/#quests","text":"","title":"Quests"},{"location":"quests/#concept","text":"The concept of a Quest is that of a journey, taken to achieve a certain goal.
